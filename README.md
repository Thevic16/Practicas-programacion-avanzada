Practice 2:
In this practice, the use of the Javalin library will be developed, taking into account the elements that 
compose it such as requests, responses and how to use it together with the template system. Javalin
is a lightweight Framework which was designed for handling WebSocjets,HTTP protocol and
asynchronous requests. In the case of this assignment the Thymeleaf template system was used, this 
Java programming language library allows you to create views using the controller view model in our web 
applications,therefore, make pages that are capable of displaying information dynamically.
Thegeneral objective of this practice is the development of a web application of a shopping cart that
processes the requests and delivers response according to the management, purchase and sale of 
the items in the application, in addition to integrating the concepts of HTML, CSS and others to 
present a friendly visual interface to the user.
