Practice 2:
In this practice, the use of the Javalin library will be developed, taking into account the elements that 
compose it such as requests, responses and how to use it together with the template system. Javalin
is a lightweight Framework which was designed for handling WebSocjets,HTTP protocol and
asynchronous requests. In the case of this assignment the Thymeleaf template system was used, this 
Java programming language library allows you to create views using the controller view model in our web 
applications,therefore, make pages that are capable of displaying information dynamically.
Thegeneral objective of this practice is the development of a web application of a shopping cart that
processes the requests and delivers response according to the management, purchase and sale of 
the items in the application, in addition to integrating the concepts of HTML, CSS and others to 
present a friendly visual interface to the user.

Practice 3:
In this practice, several sections were made related to the integration of JDBC  (Java  Database  Connectivity)  para la  persistencia  de  la  informacion  en  our  applications. For  this  purpose,  the Embedded       database  called H2 will   be  used  as  detailed      later,  which allows us  to  store  the  data  in the client's system without the need to install a database engine.   Another aspect  that will be touched on in this report is the   Javalin process, in  requests, responses,  use of templates and others, since new functionalities were added such as the creation of a new administrator user and reminder of the connection of that user when starting section. Finally, the process used to give greater security to the    user's information    through  the  Java  Simplified Encryption library is detail  .

Practice 4:
In this practice, a program is carried out that seeks to implement the concepts of ORM, which is a 
programming technique to convert data between relational databases and object-oriented 
programming languages such as Java. Another of the main objectives of this practice is to upload the 
application to a cloud server in this case using the tools provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services), 
AWS is a cloud platform that offers more than 200 comprehensive data center services globally. 
Other concepts seen in previous practices such as the management of the Javalin library, the H2 
Embedded database among others are used in this practice.

Practice 5:
In this practice we sought to implement the concept of SSL security certificates, for this purpose the service was used Letsencrypt.org which offers certificates for free. More specifically, Apache was configured for the management of certificates, also using the concept of Virtual Host and redirection of requests. To achieve everything described above, a domain validated by a NIC was obtained and the services of a DNS (Domain name server) were used. Below, it will be detailed how this process was carried out.
